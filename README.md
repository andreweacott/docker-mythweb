# MythWeb Docker Image

This repository provides a Dockerized version of **MythWeb**, the classic web frontend for [MythTV](https://www.mythtv.org/).

Since MythWeb has been deprecated in recent MythTV releases and is no longer included in the v35+ ubuntu packages, this image helps continue hosting it in a convenient, containerized way.

> üõ†Ô∏è **Note:** You must have a working MythTV backend and accessible database for MythWeb to function.
